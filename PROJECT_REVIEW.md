## 🔧 Core Components

### 1. GdtParser.cs
**Purpose**: Parse Black Ops 3 .gdt files and extract asset definitions

**Key Features**:
- Regex-based parsing of GDT syntax (`"asset_name" ( "type.gdf" )`)
- Detects 40+ file property names (models, textures, maps, etc.)
- Identifies 30+ sound alias properties (fireSound, reloadSound, etc.)
- **Dynamic sound action detection**: Scans for `customnoteX_action = "Sound"` patterns and extracts corresponding `customnoteX_actionparam` values
- **Shared weapon sounds resolution**: Cross-references `sharedWeaponSounds` properties across common GDT files
- **FX file detection**: Properties ending with "Effect" containing `fx\*.efx` paths
- Handles nested brace structures for complex asset definitions
- Returns structured data: asset name, type, file paths, sound aliases

**Data Model**:
```csharp
public class GdtAsset
{
    string Name                        // Asset identifier
    string Type                        // GDF type (weapon, vehicle, etc.)
    List<string> FilePaths            // All file references
    List<string> SoundAliases         // Direct sound references
    List<string> SharedWeaponSounds   // Cross-GDT sound references
}
```

**Special Handling**:
- **Sound Actions**: Dynamically detects `customnote1_action = "Sound"` → extracts `customnote1_actionparam = "wpn_ar_sound"`
- **Shared Sounds**: Looks up `sharedWeaponSounds = "t9_ar_common"` by searching `_wpn_t9_common.gdt` and similar files
- **FX Files**: Detects `muzzleFlashEffect = "fx\weapon\muzzle_flash.efx"` and extracts path

### 2. AssetScanner.cs
**Purpose**: Scan BO3 file system and resolve all asset paths

**Key Features**:
- **Smart path resolution** with directory-specific rules:
  - **Sound files**: `sound_assets\{path}` (NOT `share\raw\sound\`)
  - **Animations**: `xanim_export\{path}` with `model_export\` fallback
  - **FX files**: `share\raw\fx\{path}`
  - **Textures**: Skip engine placeholders (`$white`, `$black`, etc.)
  - **Models**: `model_export\{path}`
- **Sound alias resolution**: Parses CSV files to extract actual .wav/.flac file paths
- **Recursive alias chaining**: Follows `#alias > #alias > file.wav` chains
- **File existence verification** with size tracking
- **Missing file reporting** for troubleshooting

**Path Resolution Examples**:
```
Input:  "dog_attack_sound"           → sound_assets\zm\zm_dog_attack.wav
Input:  "t6_zombie_walk"             → xanim_export\zm_t6_zombie_walk.xanim_export
Input:  "fx\zombie\blood_spray"      → share\raw\fx\zombie\blood_spray.efx
Input:  "c_t8_mp_ar_rifle_body"      → model_export\c_t8_mp_ar_rifle_body.xmodel_export
```

### 3. SoundAliasParser.cs
**Purpose**: Parse Black Ops 3 sound alias CSV files

**Key Features**:
- Reads CSV files from `sound\aliases\` directory
- Extracts alias names and actual file paths (Column 4)
- **Recursive alias resolution**: Follows `#` prefix chains
- Supports all BO3 CSV formats (zm, mp, cp, core)
- Handles quoted CSV values and special characters

**CSV Format**:
```csv
Name,          Subtitle,  Platform,  File,                           Vol,  ...
wpn_ar_shoot,  ,          pc,        sound_assets\wpn\ar_shoot.wav,  0.8,  ...
wpn_generic,   ,          pc,        #wpn_ar_shoot,                  1.0,  ...
```

### 4. PackageCreator.cs
**Purpose**: Create distributable ZIP packages with proper BO3 structure

**Key Features**:
- **Three sound packaging modes**:
  1. **Consolidated CSV**: Creates custom CSV with only used aliases (reduces file size)
  2. **Copy Full CSV**: Includes entire original CSV files
  3. **Skip Sounds**: No sound files in package
- **Directory structure preservation**: Maintains BO3 folder hierarchy
- **Async progress reporting**: Real-time updates via `IPackageProgress` interface
- **Compression options**: NoCompression, Fastest, Optimal
- **Error handling**: Tracks failed copies, reports warnings
- **Statistics tracking**: File counts, total size, duration

**Package Structure**:
```
weapon_package.zip
├── sound_assets\
│   └── wpn\ar_shoot.wav
├── sound\aliases\
│   └── echo_consolidated.csv
├── model_export\
│   └── weapon_model.xmodel_export
├── xanim_export\
│   └── weapon_reload.xanim_export
└── share\raw\fx\
    └── muzzle_flash.efx
```

**Progress Interface**:
```csharp
public interface IPackageProgress
{
    void ReportProgress(int current, int total, string message);
    void ReportLog(string message);
}
```

## 🔮 Future Development - TODO List

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. **Model Attachments Detection** ⚠️ **START WITH THIS**
**Problem**: Weapons often reference attachments in separate GDT files (scopes, grips, stocks, etc.)

**Investigation Needed**:
- Locate property names that reference attachment GDT entries
- Check for patterns like `attachment1`, `gunsmith_attach_scope`, etc.
- Test with actual weapon GDT files to identify reference format
- Determine if attachments are in same GDT or external files
- Cross-reference common attachment GDT files (e.g., `_attachments_common.gdt`)

**Implementation**:
- Add attachment property detection to `GdtParser.cs`
- Create attachment resolution method (similar to `ResolveSharedWeaponSounds`)
- Scan common attachment GDT files for referenced entries
- Extract all file paths from resolved attachment assets
- Update UI to show attachment resolution status

**Testing Plan**:
1. Open a weapon GDT file (e.g., AR, SMG)
2. Identify properties that reference attachments

## 📝 Important Notes

### ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Start with Model Attachments**
Before implementing any other features, the model attachment detection must be investigated and implemented. This is a core feature that directly impacts package completeness.

**Why this is critical**:
- Weapons are incomplete without attachments (scopes, grips, etc.)
- Most weapon GDT files reference external attachment definitions
- Users expect a "complete" weapon package to include all visible parts
- Missing attachments cause game crashes or invisible models

**Action Items**:
1. Open several weapon GDT files (AR, SMG, LMG, etc.)
2. Search for properties containing "attach", "scope", "grip", "stock"
3. Note the format of attachment references (asset names vs file paths)
4. Locate common attachment GDT files in BO3 installation
5. Test manual resolution to confirm approach
6. Implement automated detection and resolution
7. Update UI to display "Attachments Resolved: 5/5" status

---

### 🔧 Technical Debt
- **Error Handling**: Some edge cases may not be caught (empty GDT files, corrupt CSVs)
- **Memory Usage**: Large GDT files are fully loaded into memory (could use streaming)
- **Code Duplication**: Some path resolution logic is repeated (could be refactored)
- **Unit Tests**: No automated testing currently implemented

---

### 📚 Documentation Needs
- **User Manual**: Step-by-step guide for new users
- **API Documentation**: XML comments for all public methods
- **Modding Guide**: How BO3 assets work and why Echo is needed
- **Troubleshooting FAQ**: Common issues and solutions

---

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- **Tooltips**: Add helpful tooltips to all buttons and settings
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+O for open, Ctrl+S for scan, F5 for refresh, etc.
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, high contrast mode
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions between states
- **Status Bar**: Persistent status info at bottom of window
